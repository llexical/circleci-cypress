# CircleCi Cypress

Very bare bones [NextJs](https://nextjs.org/) setup using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) end to end tests through [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) as a basic boilerplate to demo how all can be used together to support continuous integration.

## Setup
- clone or fork this repo and push it up to your own github or bitbucket account.
- Go to  [circleci.com](https://circleci.com/docs/1.0/getting-started/) and follow the instructions to get setup with an account.
- Once you have a project setup watch the tests run each time you push to the repo.
